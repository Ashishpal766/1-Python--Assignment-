        "\n",
        "1. Readability and Simplicity:\n",
        "\n",
        "Clean Syntax: Python has a very clear and concise syntax that resembles plain English. This reduces the learning curve significantly, making it easier for beginners to pick up and for experienced programmers to quickly understand and write code.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  Extensive Standard Library:\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Batteries Included\": Python comes with a rich standard library that provides a wide range of modules and functions for various tasks, including file I/O, networking, web development, operating system interaction, and more. This reduces the need to write code from scratch for common functionalities.\n",
